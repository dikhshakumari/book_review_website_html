                <br>
                I couldn’t put it down. It was not because the content was happy, because it’s not, but the author did a really
                 <br>
                good job creating a realistic story working with the concept of “There is no such thing as bad people. We are all
                <br> 
                just people who do bad things.” It was both an easy read and a very emotional read as I know people who live this
                <br>
                 kind of life and have to make these kind of decisions and who are wonderful and strong people.</p></h3>

                <br>
                find this was a sequel to his first one "Five Point Someone" that had the characters I liked the most.
                <br>
                The book is all about an IIMA couple’s struggle to marry. Krish is north Indian Punjabi boy Krish in
                <br>
                 love with Tamilian Brahmin girl Ananya. (Chetan Bhagat too is Punjabi and his wife is a South Indian.) 
                 <br>
                 The only catch is, Krish and Ananya don’t want to elope or be estranged to their families, therefore, 
                 <br>
                 they choose to convince their parents for the marriage.

                      more palatable to modern audiences.

                               in part that some pages only have a few words or a paragraph on them). Still - it's not easy
